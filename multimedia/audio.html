   <p>The movie Taxi driver shows the deterioration of a mentally unhinged veteran, which leads up to a murderous rampage.Throughout the movie, masculinity and violence become more prominent and driving parts of the main character's personality. Although he ends
up getting what he wants and is lauded as a hero in the end, he causes destruction in the lives of people he seems to care about and unsettles the audience by showing a seemingly normal man with somewhat relatable problems quickly becoming violent and insane.
The soundtrack in this movie is great, helping to build a sense of growing unease, and changing to fit the main character's changing attitude and psyche.  I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a normal person driven to do unspeakable things through a mixture of toxic idealogy and unlucky circumstances.</p>
